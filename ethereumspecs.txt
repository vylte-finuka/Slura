JUMP
8
counter
Alter the program counter
Since	Group
Frontier	Stack Memory Storage and Flow Operations
Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
The program counter (PC) is a byte offset in the deployed code. It indicates which instruction will be executed next. When an ADD is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The PUSH instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The JUMP instruction alters the program counter, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed code. It is used to implement functionalities like functions.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
counter: byte offset in the deployed code where execution will continue from. Must be a JUMPDEST instruction.
Example
See in playground.

When an ADD is executed, for example, the PC is incremented by 1, since the instruction is 1 byte. The PUSH instructions are bigger than one byte, and so will increment the counter accordingly.

The JUMPI instruction may alter the program counter, thus breaking the linear path of the execution to another point in the deployed code. It is used to implement functionalities like loops and conditions.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
counter: byte offset in the deployed code where execution will continue from. Must be a JUMPDEST instruction.
b: the program counter will be altered with the new value only if this value is different from 0. Otherwise, the program counter is simply incremented and the next instruction will be executed.

Index 1 is top of the stack.

Notes
Copying takes place as if an intermediate buffer was used, allowing the destination and source to overlap. If size > 0 and (src + size or dst + size) is beyond the current memory size, the memory is extended with respective gas cost applied.

Stack input
destOffset: byte offset in the memory where the result will be copied.
offset: byte offset in the memory from which to copy.
size: byte size to copy.

Notes
The new value is put on top of the stack, incrementing all the other value indices. The values for a specific opcode thus have to be pushed in reverse order of the stack. For example, with MSTORE, the first value pushed would have to be value, and then offset.

Stack output

CREATE
32000
value
offset
size
address
Create a new account with associated code
Since	Group
Frontier	System operations
Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Creates a new contract using the initialisation code provided at the indicated offset in the memory. Enters a new sub context of the calculated destination address and executes the initialisation code, then resumes the current context.

Should deployment succeed, the new account's code is set to the return data resulting from executing the initialisation code.

The destination address is calculated as the rightmost 20 bytes (160 bits) of the Keccak-256 hash of the rlp encoding of the sender address followed by its nonce. That is:

address = keccak256(rlp([sender_address,sender_nonce]))[12:]
Deployment can fail due to:

A contract already exists at the destination address (can happen in combination with CREATE2 and SELFDESTRUCT).
Insufficient value to send.
Sub context reverted.
Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
Call depth limit reached.
Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
value: value in wei to send to the new account.
offset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the initialisation code for the new account.
size: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).
Stack output
address: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.
Examples
See in playground.

Error cases
The state changes done by the current context are reverted in those cases:

Not enough gas.
Not enough values on the stack.
The current execution context is from a STATICCALL (since Byzantium fork) or an EXTSTATICCALL (since EOF fork).
size is greater than the chain's maximum initcode size (since Shanghai fork).
Gas
minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32
init_code_cost = 2 * minimum_word_size
code_deposit_cost = 200 * deployed_code_size

static_gas = 32000
dynamic_gas = init_code_cost + memory_expansion_cost + deployment_code_execution_cost + code_deposit_cost
The deployment_code_execution_cost is the cost of whatever opcode is run to deploy the new contract. On top of that, there are additional costs for storing the code of the new contract and performing a jumpdest-analysis, respectively shown as code_deposit_cost and init_code_cost. The memory expansion cost explanation can be found here.

The new contract address is added in the warm addresses. See section access sets.

Message-call into an account
Since	Group
Frontier	System operations
Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Creates a new sub context and execute the code of the given account, then resumes the current one. Note that an account with no code will return success as true.

If the size of the return data is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY (since the Byzantium fork).

From the Tangerine Whistle fork, gas is capped at all but one 64th (remaining_gas / 64) of the remaining gas of the current context. If a call tries to send more, the gas is changed to match the maximum allowed.

If the caller doesn't have enough balance to send the value, the call fails but the current context is not reverted.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
gas: amount of gas to send to the sub context to execute. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one.
address: the account which context to execute.
value: value in wei to send to the account.
argsOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the calldata of the sub context.
argsSize: byte size to copy (size of the calldata).
retOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, where to store the return data of the sub context.
retSize: byte size to copy (size of the return data).
Stack output
success: return 0 if the sub context reverted, 1 otherwise.
Examples
See in playground.

Error cases
The state changes done by the current context are reverted in those cases:

Not enough gas.
Not enough values on the stack.
The current execution context is from a STATICCALL (since Byzantium fork) or an EXTSTATICCALL (since EOF fork) and the value is not 0.
Gas
static_gas = 0
dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost + address_access_cost + positive_value_cost + value_to_empty_account_cost
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found here.

The different costs are:

code_execution_cost is the cost of the called code execution (limited by the gas parameter).
If address is warm, then address_access_cost is 100, otherwise it is 2600. See section access sets.
If value is not 0, then positive_value_cost is 9000. In this case there is also a call stipend that is given to make sure that a basic fallback function can be called. 2300 is thus removed from the cost, and also added to the gas input.
If value is not 0 and the address given points to an empty account, then value_to_empty_account_cost is 25000. An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code.

Error cases
The state changes done by the current context are reverted in those cases:

Not enough gas.
Not enough values on the stack.
Gas
static_gas = 0
dynamic_gas = memory_expansion_cost + code_execution_cost + address_access_cost + positive_value_cost
The memory expansion cost explanation can be found here.

The different costs are:

code_execution_cost is the cost of the called code execution (limited by the gas parameter).
If address is warm, then address_access_cost is 100, otherwise it is 2600. See section access sets.
If value is not 0, then positive_value_cost is 9000. In this case there is also a call stipend that is given to make sure that a basic fallback function can be called. 2300 is thus removed from the cost, and also added to the gas input.

Message-call into this account with an alternative account’s code, but persisting the current values for sender and value
Since	Group

Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Creates a new sub context as if calling itself, but with the code of the given account. In particular the storage, the current sender and the current value remain the same. Note that an account with no code will return success as true.

If the size of the return data is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY (since the Byzantium fork).

From the Tangerine Whistle fork, gas is capped at all but one 64th (remaining_gas / 64) of the remaining gas of the current context. If a call tries to send more, the gas is changed to match the maximum allowed.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
gas: amount of gas to send to the sub context to execute. The gas that is not used by the sub context is returned to this one.
address: the account which code to execute.
argsOffset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the calldata of the sub context.

address
Create a new account with associated code at a predictable address
Since	Group
Constantinople	System operations
Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Equivalent to CREATE, except the salt allows the new contract to be deployed at a consistent, deterministic address.

Should deployment succeed, the account's code is set to the return data resulting from executing the initialisation code.

The destination address is calculated as follows:

initialisation_code = memory[offset:offset+size]
address = keccak256(0xff + sender_address + salt + keccak256(initialisation_code))[12:]
Deployment can fail due to:

A contract already exists at the destination address.
Insufficient value to transfer.
Sub context reverted.
Insufficient gas to execute the initialisation code.
Call depth limit reached.
Note that these failures only affect the return value and do not cause the calling context to revert (unlike the error cases below).

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
value: value in wei to send to the new account.
offset: byte offset in the memory in bytes, the initialisation code of the new account.
size: byte size to copy (size of the initialisation code).
salt: 32-byte value used to create the new account at a deterministic address.
Stack output
address: the address of the deployed contract, 0 if the deployment failed.
Examples
See in playground.

Error cases
The state changes done by the current context are reverted in those cases:

Not enough gas.
Not enough values on the stack.
The current execution context is from a STATICCALL (since Byzantium fork) or an EXTSTATICCALL (since EOF fork).
size is greater than the chain's maximum initcode size (since Shanghai fork).
Gas
minimum_word_size = (size + 31) / 32
init_code_cost = 2 * minimum_word_size
hash_cost = 6 * minimum_word_size
code_deposit_cost = 200 * deployed_code_size

static_gas = 32000
dynamic_gas = init_code_cost + hash_cost + memory_expansion_cost + deployment_code_execution_cost + code_deposit_cost
The deployment_code_execution_cost is the cost of whatever opcode is run to deploy the new contract. On top of that, there are additional costs for storing the code of the new contract and performing a jumpdest-analysis, respectively shown as code_deposit_cost and init_code_cost. The difference with CREATE is an additional cost to hash the initialisation code before. The memory expansion cost explanation can be found here.

The new contract address is added in the warm addresses. See section access sets.

Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Creates a new sub context and executes the code of the given account, then resumes the current one. Note that an account with no code will return success as true (1).

This instruction is equivalent to CALL, except that it does not allow any state modifying instructions or sending ETH in the sub context. The disallowed instructions are CREATE, CREATE2, LOG0, LOG1, LOG2, LOG3, LOG4, SSTORE, SELFDESTRUCT, EOFCREATE, as well as CALL or EXTCALL if the value sent is not 0.

If the size of the return data is not known, it can also be retrieved after the call with the instructions RETURNDATASIZE and RETURNDATACOPY (since the Byzantium fork).

From the Tangerine Whistle fork, gas is capped at all but one 64th (remaining_gas / 64) of the remaining gas of the current context. If a call tries to send more, the gas is changed to match the maximum allowed.

Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
Stop the current context execution, revert the state changes (see STATICCALL for a list of state changing opcodes) and return the unused gas to the caller. It also reverts the gas refund to its value before the current context. If the execution is stopped with REVERT, the value 0 is put on the stack of the calling context, which continues to execute normally. The return data of the calling context is set as the given chunk of memory of this context.

Stack input
offset: byte offset in the memory in bytes. The return data of the calling context.
size: byte size to copy (size of the return data).

Halt execution and register account for later deletion or send all Ether to address (post-Cancun)
Since	Group
Frontier	System operations
Index 1 is top of the stack. See PUSH.

Notes
From cancun behavior: send all Ether in the account to the target. If executed in the same transaction a contract was created, or pre-Cancun, the current account is registered to be destroyed, and will be at the end of the current transaction. The transfer of the current balance to the given account cannot fail. In particular, the destination account code (if any) is not executed, or, if the account does not exist, the balance is still added to the given address.

Not allowed in EOFv1 code, code containing this instruction will fail validation.

Stack input
address: account to send the current balance to (see BALANCE or SELFBALANCE since Istanbul fork).
Example
See in playground.

Error cases
The state changes done by the current context are reverted in those cases:

Not enough gas.
Not enough values on the stack.
The current execution context is from a STATICCALL (since Byzantium fork) or an EXTSTATICCALL (since EOF fork).
Gas
The static gas is 5000. If a positive balance is sent to an empty account, the dynamic gas is 25000. An account is empty if its balance is 0, its nonce is 0 and it has no code. Additionally, if address is cold, there is an additional dynamic cost of 2600. See section access sets. There is no additional cost otherwise.
